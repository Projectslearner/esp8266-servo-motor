### ESP8266 Servo Motor Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to control a servo motor using an ESP8266 microcontroller. Servo motors are widely used in applications requiring precise control of angular position, such as in robotics, automation, and remote control systems.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **Servo Motor**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **External Power Source (if required)**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Servo Motor to ESP8266:**
   - **Signal Pin:** Connect the signal (PWM) pin of the servo motor to GPIO pin D5 on the ESP8266.
   - **Power Pins:** Connect the VCC (usually 5V) and GND pins of the servo motor to an appropriate power source. Ensure a common ground (GND) connection between the ESP8266 and the servo motor.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Include the necessary libraries (`ESP8266WiFi.h` and `ESP8266Servo.h`) for Wi-Fi functionality and servo control.
   - Define the GPIO pin connected to the servo motor (D5).
   - Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 for debugging purposes.
   - Attach the servo motor to the specified GPIO pin using `myServo.attach(SERVO_PIN)`.
   - Move the servo to an initial position (90 degrees) and print a message to the Serial Monitor.

2. **Operation:**
   - In the `loop()` function:
     - Sweep the servo from 0 to 180 degrees in steps.
     - Pause briefly at each position to allow the servo to reach the specified angle.
     - Sweep the servo back from 180 to 0 degrees in steps, again pausing briefly at each position.
   - The `for` loops in the `loop()` function increment or decrement the servo position, and the `myServo.write(pos)` command sets the servo to the specified position.

#### Applications
- **Robotics:** Control robotic arms or joints with precise angular movements.
- **Automation:** Actuate levers or mechanisms requiring controlled positioning.
- **Remote Control Systems:** Control the orientation of components, such as antennas or camera gimbals.

#### Notes
- **Servo Power Requirements:** Ensure the servo motor has an adequate power supply, as the ESP8266's onboard power may not suffice for larger servos.
- **Delay Tuning:** Adjust the delay value to control the speed of the servo movement. Smaller delays result in faster movements.
- **Initial Positioning:** The servo is initialized to a neutral position (90 degrees) at the start for a reference point.
